- Chi-square P-value calculation in enrichedRegions is now substantially faster (reduced to about 25% of previous implementation)
- enrichedRegions now selects regions with pval <= pvalFilter, instead of pval < pvalFilter. This allows to obtain all regions by setting pvalFilter=1.
- enrichedRegions now returns reads per kilobase per million (RPKM), as well as raw counts

- Reduced substantially the amount of memory required by rangesPlot
VERSION 0.2.3
- Fixed issue in enrichedRegions which caused it to return an object with too many spaces

- Added extendRanges and filterDuplReads methods for RangedDataList objects. Added mc.cores argument to allow for parallel computing.
- Added export2SGR method for RangedDataList objects.
- export2SGR now uses 'coverage' function instead of 'pileup', as the latter has been deprecated

- alignPeaks now returns an object of the same class as its input, instead of always returning IRangesList objects.
- Added alignPeaks method for RangedDataList objects, and parameter mc.cores to allow parallel computation.
- Major change in readAlignedBatch. Sequences from all files are now returned into a single RangedDataList object. Files are not directly saved to disk as in previous versions.
- Fixed bug in rangesPlot which caused it to plot reads longer than maxFragLength twice
- Fixed bug in genePlot which caused an error for genes with a single exon
- Added PeakLocation function. It produces the same plots as stdPeakLocation except that it doesn't standardize the coordinates.

- Corrected bug in alignPeaks which could cause sequences to start at negative indexes. 
VERSION 0.2.1

- Added enrichedRegions function to detect significantly enriched regions in sequencing experiments.
- closestGene modified: After bioC upgrade parameter multiple stoped working due to findOverlaps function that deprecated Overlaps function (which was used in previous versions). 
- closestGene: Some rbinds have been removed and do.call is used insted to use less memory.
- closestGene: Better control of downloaded refflat files has been added.
- closestGene: new parameter added (promoterInOther). If it's TRUE peaks that are in a promoter region and inside other gene will be assigned to both genes. Only works when multiple=TRUE.
VERSION 0.2.0
- Fixed bug in alignPeaks which caused it not to work when there were some chromosomes with no sequences. Also, now alignPeaks reports the estimated shift.
- readAlignedBatch deletes memory consuming objects after they have been saved to disk. This lowers memory requirements.
- readAlignedBatch forces the chromosome names to start by 'chr', to ensure compatibility with external softwares.
- Added vignette
- Added Rd file for alignPeaks
- Added export2aligned, export2SGR and rangesPlot methods for RangedData and RangedDataList objects.
